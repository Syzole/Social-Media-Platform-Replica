- Artwork submission with descriptions and tags
- Display of artwork in a social media feed
- Ability to like and comment on artworks
- User profiles with a gallery of their submitted artworks

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: For storing user data and artwork information
- **JavaScript**: The main programming language for both client-side and server-side logic
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js used to build the server-side API
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server
